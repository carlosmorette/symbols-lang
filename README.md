# Symbols

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `symbols` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:symbols, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

How this lang works? Each symbol means a thing.

```
# -> function definition
@ -> start function body
. -> ends function body
! -> print
$ -> function call
- -> separates arguments
* -> ends function call
```

Function names and arguments can have only one letter

Example of a symbols source code:
```
#sopx@$+o-p-x*$-o-p-x*.!$s112-3-4*
```
